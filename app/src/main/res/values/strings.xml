        Hey buddy.  We\'ve been having a blue winter this year. I think we
    always feel better when we do a good job of remembering all the good things in our life. So,
    this is the "Break the Winter Blues" app, the "Fight Back Against the Winter" app, the
    "Winter Won\'t Get the Best of Us" app. Every day, when you open it, this app will check to see
    what I\'ve got in store for you.  Press the dots below to explore.
    Either a video, some upbeat song, a photo, or even presents scattered around. Enjoy!</string>
